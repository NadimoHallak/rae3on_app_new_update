# An introductory overview of the application
## An educational academy asked me for a mobile app to perform some of their mathematical calculations

### > [!Concepts used]
* I have used MVVM architecture to organize the application
* Application information is stored in the mobile memory by `Hive`
* Filters on text fields using `Regex`
* I used the `singleton` concept in several places using the `get_it` package
* I used `shared_preferences` package as `singleton` to save some stuff in mobile memory
* The model layer was generated automatically by the `Hive generator`
* There is an animation using the `animate_do` and `flutter_slidable` packages
